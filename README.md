# The-Brewery-Challenge
The Brewery Challenge is a Node-RED project for automating and optimizing brewing. It tracks production, manages water usage, controls boiling and brewing, and ensures process standards. I built a Node-RED flow with real-time monitoring, simulated sensors, and automated alerts for efficiency.
